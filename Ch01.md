# Hello World!

```go
package main // Everything in Go revolves around packages
import (
    "fmt"
 ) // Import the fmt or formatting package

fucn main() { //Define main function "func" is the keyword of notice here.
    fmt.Printf("Hello, World!") // The letters aren't bytes or chars, infact in Go lang these are called "runes". This adds unicode support, enabling the language to print any printable character.
}
```

> Notice the 'P' in Printf. To export any function outside of the package or to be able to use any fucntion from a package the first letter of the function needs to be a capital letter. Same goes with other things such as variables.

## Go directory structre:

The Go compiler is built to operate on a particular directory structre. Therefore having the structre correct is very import for working with Go. The typical suggested directory structre should be like:

```
$GOPATH
      |__src
            |_<your project name>
                                |_*.go

```
If you use the defined dir structre, you cn use the Go "install" function which will store your compiled binary in a folder called bin like shown below.

```
$GOPATH
      |__src
      |     |_<your project name>
      |                         |_*.go
      |_bin/<your project name executable>
```

## Go style:
`go fmt` is a go function that enforces the Go formatting in a go source code. Go is very particular about the code formatting and things like braces after function declaration can't be overwritten.

## Getting help in Go lang

The best place to get all the documentation is `Golang.org`. But we can also have a local help program, sort of Golang's own man pages. That program is called `godoc`. It alows you to have infomation about any package, including the one you have written. e.g:

`godoc fmt Printf`

## Variables, Simple Types and Declarations

A variable in Golang can be decaled using `var` keyword. The default datatypes supported in Golang are:

* Boolean Types: They are boolean types and consists of the two predefined constants: 
1. `true`
2. `false`

> We can use the keyword `bool` to just declare a boolean, which will be initialized by the default value of `false`. As if we don't initialize any variable in Golang it gets initialized by a `Zero value` which in case of integer are '0', for float is '0.0', similarly for boolean it is false.

* Numeric Types: They are again arithmetic types and they represents 
1. Integers
2. Floating point

* String types: A string type represents the set of string values. Its value is a sequence of bytes. Strings are immutable types that is once created, it is not possible to change the contents of a string. The predeclared string type is string.

* Derived types: They include 
1. Pointer types
2. Array types
3. Structure types
4. Union types
5. Function types
6. Slice types
7. Interface types
8. Map types
9. Channel Types

Declaring a variable example:
```go
func main() {
      var message string
      message = "Hello, World!"
      fmt.Printf("message")
}
```

This gives the sense that Golang is a statically typed language such as `Java` or `C` where we have to be explicit about the datatype of the variable we wish to use. But we can bypass this requirement by using `:=` operator. e.g:
```go
func main() {
      message := "Hello, World!"
      fmt.Printf("message")
}
```

Using `:=` you can declare and assign value to a variable together giving you the feature and feel of a dynamically typed language.

> You can use the keyword `const` to declare a constant in Golang.

Multiple declaration can be used by the usage of `()` with any declarative keyword such as `var` or `const`. e.g:
```go
var (
      message1 = "Hello,"
      message2 = " World!"
)
```

Another way of explicitly declaring the datatype and assigning the value can be as:
```go
func main() {
      message := string("Hello, World!")
      fmt.Printf("message")
}
```

> The keyword `iota` can be used as a variable with the initial value of 1. All the uninitialized variables after the first usage of the keyword gets value assigned to it using the same expression in which `iota` was used. e.g:
```go
var (
      answer1 = iota
      answer2
) // answer2 will get the value of 2 as default.

var (
      answer1 = iota*2
      answer2
) // answer2 will get the value of 4 as default.
```
#### Numeric

The whole list of numeric types that are available to us in Golang is as following:

**Integer Types**

The predefine architecture-independent integer types are:

1. uint8: Unsigned 8-bit integers (0 to 255)
2. uint16: Unsigned 16-bit integers (0 to 65535)
3. uint32: Unsigned 32-bit integers (0 to 4294967295)
4. uint64: Unsigned 64-bit integers (0 to 18446744073709551615)
5. int8: Signed 8-bit integers (-128 to 127)
6. int16: Signed 16-bit integers (-32768 to 32767)
7. int32: Signed 32-bit integers (-2147483648 to 2147483647)
8. int64: Signed 64-bit integers (-9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807)

**Floating Types**

The predefine architecture-independent float types are:

1. float32: IEEE-754 32-bit floating-point numbers
2. float64: IEEE-754 64-bit floating-point numbers
3. complex64: Complex numbers with float32 real and imaginary parts
4. complex128: Complex numbers with float64 real and imaginary parts

> The value of an n-bit integer is n bits and is represented using two's complement arithmetic operations.

**Other Numeric Types**

There is also a set of numeric types with implementation-specific sizes:

1. byte: same as uint8
2. rune: same as int32
3. uint: 32 or 64 bits
4. int: same size as uint
5. uintptr: an unsigned integer to store the uninterpreted bits of a pointer value

We can use `%d` and `%f` to print integers and floating point values in a printf statement respectively. Similarly all of the `C printf` flags will work.
