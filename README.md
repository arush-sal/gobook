# This repo is to serve as a quick dive into Golang for people already familiar with computer programming.

**DISCLAIMER:**
> I have no intent to make this an official book or any sort of publication. 

> These simply are my notes that I made while learning Golang through **O'Reilly - Introduction to Go Programming**. That is an awesome course by the amazing @jgrahamc and I suggest you too check the video tutorial by him at http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920035305.do.
