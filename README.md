# This repo is to serve as a quick dive into Golang for people already familiar with computer programming.

**DISCLAIMER:**
> I have no intent to actually make this an official book or any sort of publication. 

> These are simply my personal notes that I made while learning Golang through **OReilly - Introduction to Go Programming**. That is an awesome course by the amazing @jgrahamc and I definitely suggest you to check the video tutorials by him at http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920035305.do.
